# Crossroads Classic Analytics Challenge: NCAA Ticket Purchase Prediction 🏀✨

## Introduction 🌟
The NCAA aims to enhance the student-athlete experience and offset championship costs by optimizing ticket sales for Division I Women's Basketball. Leveraging extensive customer data, our project develops predictive models to forecast ticket purchase behaviors effectively.

## Objective 🎯
Our goal is to create models using the NCAA's comprehensive customer datasets, enriched with external data sources, to predict whether customers will buy tickets, and if so, whether they will choose the primary or secondary market. These insights will guide targeted marketing strategies and optimize ticket sales efforts.

## Dataset Description 📊
- **Training Set (`DIWBB_Training.csv`)**: Contains historical data used to train our models.
- **Test Set (`DIWBB_Test.csv`)**: Used to evaluate the performance of our models.
- **Data Dictionary (`DIWBB_Data Dictionary.csv`)**: Provides detailed descriptions of each feature in the datasets.

## Methodology 🔍
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Standardization and encoding of categorical variables to prepare for modeling.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new features to capture underlying patterns and relationships.
3. **Model Development**: Implementation of various machine learning models including:
   - Gradient Boosting
   - Neural Networks
   - Ensemble Models

## Results 📈
- Our models have been trained and tested, providing a robust framework for predicting ticket purchasing behavior. The Gradient Boosting model showed the most promise with high accuracy in preliminary tests.

## Future Scope 🌐
- **Enhanced Feature Engineering**: We plan to develop additional innovative features to further improve model performance.
- **Model Diversification**: Exploring other machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods to enhance the robustness and accuracy of our predictions.

## Conclusion & Learning Opportunities 📘
This project not only provided practical experience in predictive modeling but also highlighted the potential for data science to significantly impact strategic decision-making in sports marketing. Continuing this project could include applying the models developed to other NCAA sports or refining the models as more data becomes available.
